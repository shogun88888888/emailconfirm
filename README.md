# emailconfirm
Double opt in email confirmation for user registration for Laravel 5.3

Have users confirm their registration by using double opt in via email
users will have to confirm their email by clicking a link before they can log in

copy and paste these files into a base laravel 5.3 project after running artisan make:auth
run artisan migrate after files are copied

Probably not a good idea to use on an existing project
